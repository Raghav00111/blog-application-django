Building an Blog Application using Django
Let us develop a Blog Application using Django and let others post beautiful blogs on it. Here the users will also be able to post comments on any blog. This is a very useful and popular project in Django.
A blog is basically an informational or discussion website. Logged in users can post blogs on any subject or topic that they find interesting so that everyone could see it.
The objective of the project is to implement a blog web-based application where the users will post useful and informative blogs. Basic knowledge of the front-end part and a good knowledge of Django is required to complete and understand the project.
This project requires a good knowledge of programming both in front-end and back-end.
First, letâ€™s check the steps to build the Blog Application in Python Django Framework:

1. First of all, we start a project in Django with an app inside it.
2. Then create the required folders for templates, static files (images, javascript and css files) and media (images uploaded through backend)
3. Finally, creating the required urls and views.
